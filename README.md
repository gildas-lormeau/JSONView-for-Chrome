This is a fork of

[https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome)

Mostly it just includes [this pull request](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome/pull/22) which allows the json to have a prefix to avoid a [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx).

I might add more later, but I doubt it.

JSONView-for-Chrome is a Chrome extension that allows you to view json in a nice tree and you can open/close sections too.

It is available to install on the chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nckmconehaglkoocmmldmilnnpdagigh).
