# JSONView-for-Chrome

JSONView-for-Chrome is an extension of chrome created by [gildas-lormeau](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome) 
which is very useful for people who deals a lot with json type http requests.

But sometimes we would like to handle with our own json data, not from the internet. So I added a json editor to this extension
to make it more handful. The json editor is copied from [josdejong's jsoneditor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor).
